<p style="font-family:Lucida Calligraphy,serif"align="center";">That slow burn wait while it gets dark
Bruising the sun
I feel grown up with you in your car
I know it's dumb

We both got a million bad habits to kick
Not sleeping is one
We're biting our nails, you're biting my lip
I'm biting my tongue

But people are talking, people are talking
But people are talking, people are talking

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk, 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
World alone, we're alone

All my fake friends and all of their noise
Complain about work
They're studying business, I study the floor
And you haven't stopped smoking all night
Maybe the internet raised us
Or maybe people are jerks

But people are talking, people are talking
But not you
But people are talking, people are talking

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk, 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
World alone, we're alone

All the double-edged people into schemes
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
You're my best friend and we're dancing in a world alone
World alone, we're all alone

I know we're not everlasting
We're a trainwreck waiting to happen
One day the blood won't flow so gladly
One day we'll all get still
Get still

But people are talking, people are talking
But people are talking, people are talking

Raise a glass, 'cause I'm not done saying it
They all wanna get rough, get away with it
Let 'em talk, 'cause we're dancing in this world alone
World alone, we're alone

All the double-edged people into schemes
They make a mess, then go home and get clean
You're my best friend and we're dancing in a world alone
World alone, we're all alone

But people are talking, people are talking
But people are talking, people are talking
But people are talking, people are talking
But people are talking, people are talking
Let 'em talk
